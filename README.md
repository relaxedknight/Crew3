# Welcome to the Crew3 Challenge

```Time: max 2 hours```

```Tools: any```

```Final work: git repo```

For this we want you to spend max 2 hours. If you don’t totally finish it’s totally fine, just make sure it compiles and leave it! What we’re looking for are **clean code** and a **delightful user experience**. Feel free to use any libraries you’d like and make sure you have some time in the end to add fun things like animations. 

Install in each folder with 
```yarn``` (or npm install if you prefer)

Run Client
```yarn start```

Run Server
```yarn dev```

You should choose **one** of these 2 options to complete:

### Option 1 - QuickNote
Create a component that lets you quickly jot down ideas. 
You can get inspiration from the Apple one where you open it by hovering the bottom right corner, or just a little icon button, or using a keyboard command. 
You should be able to access the notes afterward.


**If you have time:**

- Connect to the server: In the server folder you will find an Express server with the endpoints [GET] /notes and [POST] /notes. These are connected to this [Notion DB](https://humble-xylophone-ad3.notion.site/c3557f22737543de88d164cf2e64741f?v=92bb5206950249789e3b42053061d0fa)
- Possible to update or delete
- Highlight text on a page to add a quote
- QuickSketch or other fun ideas


### Option 2 - Socia-lite

You arrive at the party and you see her. She smiles at you and starts walking toward you… You’ve know you’ve met her somewhere, but where? Was it Alice? Anna? Fuck.

*Hello Anton, so nice to see you!* You glance down at your phone. 

*Alva hi! Can’t believe I haven’t seen you since Leo’s party? How are you?* Phuu, you breathe out. Saved by Socia-lite once again…

Never forget a name again. Socia-lite lets you quickly search your personal CRM by looks like hair-colour 🙋‍♀️👧🏽, age 👧🏽👵🏾 and accessories 🤓 to find people and see their info. 

You just have to build it first 😊

**If you have time:**
- Connect to the server: In the server folder you will find an Express server with the endpoints [GET] /crm and [POST] /crm. These are connected to this [Notion DB](https://humble-xylophone-ad3.notion.site/fdc1de0244a94d80a3da812c8d68dd35?v=2a54d1b388af4fe5a44713c8038c003d)
- Add more people to the list of people
- Possible to update or delete
